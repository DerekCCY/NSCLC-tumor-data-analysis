##  1. __Data Analysis__ for stratification

   - ## Description
      * In our study, we extracted the cell density of various cells from the experimental data of each participant and organized it into a data frame. This data frame is structured with thirty patients on the columns and ten different cell types on the rows, resulting in a dimension of [10 rows Ã— 30 columns]. Following this, we performed a Logarithmic Transformation on all data. This step involved applying the natural logarithm (log) to each element in the metric matrix, following the formula log(x+1), where 'x' is the original value. This transformation is highly beneficial for data covering a wide range of magnitudes, as it effectively reduces skewness and unveils more apparent patterns.

      * Subsequently, as our focus is to observe the expression of each cell type across different patients, we performed Z-score normalization for each row and converted the expression levels of each patient into a percentage format. Finally, we employed the Euclidean distance metric to calculate similarity and utilized the average linkage method for hierarchical clustering. We then generated a heatmap and a relationship connection plot. The outcomes of this analysis were visualized to provide a clearer understanding of the relationships and patterns within our data. This approach offers a comprehensive and detailed insight into the cell density dynamics in our study population.

   - ## Run
      - * `cd Clustermap`
      - * `python clustermap.py`
      - * Log normalization
   
   - ## Results in 'Images/Clustermap' file
      - * show the expression level of immune cell and cluster them into groups


##  2. __Data Analysis__ for thresholding

   - ## Description
      * Define signal intensity thresholds and thus redefine the selected immune subsets with high accuracy through data

      * Select the columns (immune cells) we want to observe to calculate their mean value and std value, and then define the threshold.

      * Project the values from excel to images

   - ## Run
      - * `cd Thresholding`
      - * `python threshold_define.py`
   
   - ## Results in 'Images/Thresholding' file
      - * show the data distribution
